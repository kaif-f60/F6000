// This is a simple JavaScript program that uses the OpenAI API to generate text based on a given prompt.       
// It uses the 'axios' library to make HTTP requests and the 'dotenv' library to load environment variables from a .env file.
// The program defines a function 'generateText' that takes a prompt as input and returns the generated text from the OpenAI API.
// The program also includes error handling to catch any errors that may occur during the API request.
